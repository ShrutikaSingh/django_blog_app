Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))

Serving files uploaded by a user during developmentÂ¶
During development, you can serve user-uploaded media files from MEDIA_ROOT using the django.views.static.serve() view.

This is not suitable for production use! For some common deployment strategies, see Deploying static files.

For example, if your MEDIA_URL is defined as /media/, you can do this by adding the following snippet to your urls.py:

This helper function works only in debug mode and only if the given prefix is local (e.g. /media/) and not a URL (e.g. http://media.example.com/).




if settings.DEBUG: #adding this only when we are in debug mode means during production not during deployment
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)# ... the rest of your URLconf goes here ...
'''


if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
