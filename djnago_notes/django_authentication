authentication system for django 

for creating register and login page
open up prject urls.py and import login and register models

to create the app named users that will handle all the user login
>python manage.py startapp users

so now ls
and we will see have have our users app
so now we have blog, django-project,users app
having many built in files

and now we want to create user registration page


very important
so the first step will be to add it in the installed apps in setting.py file in django_project

so for that name you fist go to -> users app that you created -> apps.py and then copy the function UsersConfig

class UsersConfig(AppConfig):
    name = 'users'

 and add it to the installed app section in settings.py
 add   'users.apps.UsersConfig',

now we have to create the register page in views.py
so add forms in views.py that django has already created

**from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm #django has already created the form for us
