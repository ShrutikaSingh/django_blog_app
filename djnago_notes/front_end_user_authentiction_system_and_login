creating an authetication system for user can login and log out and also set up login for usrs to access certain pages
login page from front end
so first of all we have to import login and logout views within our projects url model

from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views #for user login and logout

add login and logout url_pattern
url('login/',auth_views.LoginView.as_view(),name='login'),
url('login/',auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(),name='logout'),


login and logout are class based views so LoginView above is in camel case since its default

and when we fo to http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/
it says 
TemplateDoesNotExist at /login/

we get a exception view
Exception Value:	
registration/login.html  it the place where django  login view looks for template default

so now we could create registration folder in our template and create a login.html template there
but we can create login template inside our user template along side our register page that we crerated and we can tell 
django to look out there istead of registration/login.html

and in the djnago_project /url we can tell django to whre to look for login.html

so in he url we  can tell django to go to which url and we wil pass the location i.eusers/login.html as an argument to the as_view()   both for login and logout
    url('login/',auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='users/login.html'),name='login'),  #pass teh template location i.e users/login.html as an argument to as_view 



    and now create the login.html and logout.html template in users/template/users/ folder
