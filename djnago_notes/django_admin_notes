first stop the development server
ctrl+c
1)to create  a new user for super user to login to the admin page

djnago_project folder>>>python manage.py createsuperuser 

if you run this it will not work
OperationalError: no such table: auth_user

the problem is that we haven't created the database for the project it
so we have to create the database
for that we have to run few migrations
database migrations allows us to apply changes to data base

the  first migration will create the database and will add a bunch of
initial tables and auth_user is one of the table

shrutika@shrutika-HP-ProBook-440-G4:~/Desktop/Innovator_wd_django/djnago_project$ python manage.py makemigrations

djnago_project folder>>>>python manage.py makemigrations
No changes detected
since we don't have created any database and table
so make migrations just detects the changes and prepares django to update the database

in order to apply the migrations we need to run
python mannage.py migrate

shrutika@shrutika-HP-ProBook-440-G4:~/Desktop/Innovator_wd_django/djnago_project$ python manage.py migrate

now again run the createsuper user command
shrutika@shrutika-HP-ProBook-440-G4:~/Desktop/Innovator_wd_django/djnago_project$ python manage.py createsuperuser
